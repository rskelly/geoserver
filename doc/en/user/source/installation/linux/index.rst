GeoServer requires a *Java 7* runtime to be installed on your system. For more information about Java and GeoServer please see the section on :ref:`production_java`.

The most common way to install GeoServer is using the OS-independent binary.  This version is a GeoServer web application (webapp) bundled inside `Jetty <http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/>`_, a lightweight servlet container system.  It has the advantages of working very similarly across all operating systems plus being very simple to set up.
